The chant consists of several verses that describe the Goddess as the embodiment of different qualities and phenomena, such as wisdom, sleep, hunger, thirst, patience, modesty, and so on. By invoking the Goddess in these ways, the devotee expresses gratitude and reverence for her presence and blessings in every aspect of existence. The chant also acknowledges that the Goddess is both ancient and new, transcending time and space.
 
The chant has a profound meaning and significance for those who recite it with devotion and understanding. According to Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, a spiritual leader and founder of The Art of Living Foundation, the chant represents the Devi's presence across universe and time. With the message of the Devi's presence in the things, people, and situations we dislike and like both, the chant is meant to evoke irrevocable equanimity in a devotee.
 
The following are the lyrics and translation of the chant:
