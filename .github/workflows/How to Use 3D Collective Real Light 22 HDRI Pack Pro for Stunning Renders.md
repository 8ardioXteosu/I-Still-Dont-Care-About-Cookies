## What is an HDRI and Why You Need It
 
An HDRI (High Dynamic Range Image) is a type of image that contains more information than a normal image. It can store a wider range of brightness values, from very dark to very bright. This allows it to capture the contrast and detail of real-world lighting conditions.
 
When you use an HDRI as a background or a light source in your 3D scene, you are essentially recreating the lighting and reflections of the original location where the HDRI was taken. This means that your 3D objects will look more natural and integrated with the environment, and you will not have to worry about setting up complex lighting rigs or tweaking materials.
 
## How to Use the 3D Collective Real Light 22 HDRI Pack Pro
 
The 3D Collective Real Light 22 HDRI Pack Pro contains 22 HDR images that cover different scenarios, such as urban, rural, sunset, sunrise, cloudy, clear, etc. Each image has a resolution of 12000 x 6000 pixels and comes with a preview JPG file. You can download the pack from the [official website](https://www.3dcollective.es/en/producto/real-light-22-hdri-pack-pro/) for â¬59.90 (about $72).
 
To use the pack in your 3D software, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Import the HDRI file into your scene as an environment texture. Depending on your software, you might need to use a specific node or shader to do this. For example, in Blender, you can use the Environment Texture node in the World settings.
2. Adjust the rotation and scale of the HDRI to match your scene. You can also adjust the brightness and contrast of the HDRI using color correction nodes or tools.
3. Enable global illumination or indirect lighting in your render settings. This will allow the HDRI to cast light and shadows on your objects.
4. Enable ray tracing or image-based lighting in your render settings. This will allow the HDRI to create realistic reflections on your objects.
5. Render your scene and enjoy the results!

## Tips and Tricks for Better Renders
 
Here are some tips and tricks that can help you improve your renders using the 3D Collective Real Light 22 HDRI Pack Pro:

- Use a high-quality camera model with realistic settings, such as focal length, aperture, exposure, etc. This will make your renders look more professional and cinematic.
- Use depth of field to create a shallow focus effect and draw attention to your main subject.
- Use post-processing effects such as color grading, bloom, glare, vignette, etc. to enhance the mood and atmosphere of your renders.
- Use complementary elements such as models, textures, props, etc. that match the style and theme of your chosen HDRI.
- Experiment with different HDRIs from the pack and see how they affect your scene. You might discover new possibilities and combinations that you didn't think of before.

## Conclusion
 
The 3D Collective Real Light 22 HDRI Pack Pro is a great resource for anyone who wants to create realistic and stunning renders using HDR images. It offers a variety of scenarios and lighting conditions that can suit any project or style. You can use it in any 3D software that supports HDRIs, and achieve amazing results
